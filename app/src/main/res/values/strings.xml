    <string name="about_dialog_message">2048 is played on a gray 4x4 grid, with numbered tiles that
        slide when a player moves them using swipe moves: to top, to bottom, to left or to right.
        Tiles slide as far as possible in the chosen direction until they are stopped by either another tile or the edge of the grid.

        \n\nIf two tiles of the same number collide while moving, they will merge into a tile with the total value of the two tiles that collided.
        The resulting tile cannot merge with another tile again in the same move.

        \n\nEvery turn, a new tile will randomly appear in an empty spot on the board with a value of either 2 or 4.

        \n\nThe user\'s score starts at zero, and is incremented whenever two tiles combine, by the value of the new tile.

        \n\nThe game is won when a tile with a value of 2048 appears on the board.
        After reaching the 2048 tile, players can continue to play to reach higher scores.
        When the player has no legal moves (there are no empty spaces and no adjacent tiles with the same value), the game ends.</string>
